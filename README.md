## Overview
A full-stack taxi application that provides a robust backend API and a responsive frontend interface. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT for authentication, while the frontend is implemented using React and Vite. Real-time functionalities, such as live location updates, are powered by Socket.io.

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: Located in the `Backend` directory. Contains:
  - Express server and API routes for users, captains, maps, and rides.
  - A socket implementation for real-time communication.
  - Environment configuration and database connection.
- **Frontend**: Located in the `Frontend` directory. Contains:
  - A React application built with Vite.
  - Routing, context providers (User, Captain, Socket), and pages for login, registration, and ride management.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, Socket.io, Google Maps API
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, React Router

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14+)
- npm
